bbsim - Buffalo Byte Mesh Network Simulator

This simulator contains two components, one which simulates the Buffalo Byte
mesh network and movement (bin/bbsim), and the other which performs simulations
for a range of parameters, and plots the resuts with gnuplot (./run_sims.sh).

bin/bbsim -t -n -ttl -p [-anim] [-csv]
	-t   <value> Simulation runtime in seconds
	-n   <value> Number of nodes in the network
	-ttl <value> Time to leave (TTL) for all packets sent
	-p   <value> The interval at which packets are sent in seconds
	-[anim]      Generate a NetAnim animation XML
	-[csv]       Perform a single-BB movement simulation

./run_sims.sh <CSV output file> <gnuplot output PNG> <number of nodes>

Simulation results from ./run_sims.sh can be found in results/
